Dear COVID19 Forecasting Hub Community Members,

Based on the attached plot of your team's recent incident hospitalization forecast submissions, we are concerned by your model's lack of consistency and calibration for some locations in predicting the target data source of hospitalizations from HealthData.gov.

Could you confirm that your forecasted predictive intervals do indeed refer to the HealthData.gov hospitalization counts?

Thank you for participating in this important effort to provide the CDC with reliable and actionable short-term forecasts of the pandemic's trajectory in the US.

Best wishes,
